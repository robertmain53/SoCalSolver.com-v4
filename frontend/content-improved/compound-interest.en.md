# Compound Interest Calculator (Improved)

:::explain
**Formula:**
A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

Where:
- A = final amount
- P = principal
- r = annual interest rate
- n = times compounded per year
- t = years

**Example:**
If you invest $1,000 at 5% annual interest, compounded monthly for 10 years:
A = 1000(1 + 0.05/12)^(12*10) ≈ $1,647.01

**Mistake to avoid:**
Don’t forget to convert the interest rate to a decimal (5% = 0.05).

:::learn
Compound interest is powerful because it means you earn interest on your interest. This is why savings grow faster over time. Albert Einstein reportedly called it "the eighth wonder of the world."

:::challenge
If you double the compounding frequency (from yearly to semiannual), what happens to the final amount? Try it with P = $500, r = 4%, t = 5 years.
